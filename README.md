Welcome to the repotistory with a set of five console games built on the principle of popular mobile brain training applications.

|       Game        |                      Goal                     |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|`brain-even   `    | answer whether number is even or not          |       
|`brain-calc`       | execute some simple math operations: +, - or *|      
|`brain-gcd`        | find greatest common divisor for two numbers  |
|`brain-prime`      | answer whether number is prime or not         |
|`brain-progression`| guess hidden element of arithmetic progression| 

*To win the game you have to successfully finish three round in a row.*


## Quickstart

```bash
pip install git+HTTPS
```

## Running

The programm supports five scripts to play a certain game:
```bash
brain-even
brain-calc
brain-gcd
brain-prime
brain-progression
```
You can also use `brain-games` to only see the greeting.
